Little somethin for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corinne
Some say the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares and dont nobody else care
And uhh I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothas clown a lot
But please dont cry dry your eyes never let up
Forgive but dont forget girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you aint nuttin dont believe him
And if he cant learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you dont need him
And I aint tryin to gas ya up I just call em how I see em
You know it makes me unhappy
When brothas make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women do we hate our women
I think its time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women be real to our women
And if we dont well have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man cant make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know youre fed up ladies but keep your head up
Keep ya head up oooo child things are gonna get easier
ooooo child things are gonna get brighter
Aiyyo I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing ta me
He had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didnt seem so tough
And though we had it rough we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how Id rock the mic and make it to tha bright screen
Im tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Its hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems Im headin for tha pen
I try and find my friends but theyre blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
Its gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rainll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up
You know its funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but cant feed the poor
Say there aint no hope for the youth and the truth is
it aint no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
We aint meant to survive cause its a setup
And even though youre fed up
Huh ya got to keep your head up
To all the ladies havin babies on they own
I know its kinda rough and youre feelin all alone
Daddys long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want em
Cause I think we can make it in fact Im sure
And if you fall stand tall and comeback for more
Cause aint nuttin worse than when your son
wants to kno why his daddy dont love him no mo
You cant complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man feelin helpless
Because theres too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside but outside youre looking fearless
While tears is rollin down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things dont all down this week
Cause if it did you couldnt take it and dont blame me
I was given this world I didnt make it
And now my sons getten older and older and cold
From havin the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin Benz
Im still tryin to hold on to my survivin friends
And its crazy it seems itll never let up but

Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill three quarts of my blood into the street let alone the heat
Fuck em we hate a nigga lovin this life
In all possible ways know the Feds is buggin my life
Hospital days reflectin when my man laid up
On the Uptown high block he got his side sprayed up

That made him smile though his eyes said Pray for me
Ill do you one better and slay these niggaz faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest its a slow process

Dead presidentials politics as usual
Dead presidents to represent me
Dead presidents to represent me
Dead presidents to represent me
Dead presidents to represent me I sit alone in my fourcornered room
Oh that shit is on Heh
Let me drop some shit like this here
At night I cant sleep I toss and turn
Candle sticks in the dark visions of bodies being burned
Four walls just staring at a nigga
Im paranoid sleeping with my finger on the trigger
My mothers always stressing I aint living right
But I aint going out without a fight
See everytime my eyes close
I start sweatin and blood starts comin out my nose
Its somebody watchin the Ak
But I dont know who it is so Im watchin my back
I can see him when Im deep in the covers
When I awake I dont see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say take a chill B
But fuck that shit theres a nigga trying to kill me
Im poppin in a clip when the wind blows
Every twenty seconds got me peeping out my window
Investigating the joint for traps
Checking my telephone for taps
Im staring at the woman on the corner
Its fucked up when your mind is playing tricks on you
I make big money I drive big cars
Everybody know me its like Im a movie star
But late at night somethin aint right
I feel Im being tailed by the same suckers head lights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot
Or is it the one I beat for five thousand dollars
Thought he had caine but it was Gold Medal Flour
Reach under my seat grabbed my popper for the suckers
Aint no use to be lying I was scareder than a motherfucker
But theyre laughing at pow pies and buried that quick
If its going down lets get this shit over with
Here they come just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfucking trigger
What I sawll make your ass start giggling
Three black crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go
I keep looking over my shoulder and peeping around corners
My mind is playing tricks on me
Day by day its more impossible to cope
I feel like Im the one thats doing dope
Cant keep a steady hand because Im nervous
Every Sunday morning Im in service
And trying to find an exit out of the business
I know the Lord is looking at me
But yet and still its hard for me to feel happy
I often drift while I drive
Havin fatal thoughts of suicide
BANG and get it over with
And then Im worryfree but thats bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I died then my child would be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now shes back with her mother
Now Im realizing that I love her
My mind is playing tricks on me
This year Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boyz are trickortreating
Robbing little kids for bags
Till an old man got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
Wed be in for a squable no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was going down we figured
But this was no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now thats the nigga Id been seeing in my sleep
So we tripleteamed on him
Dropping them motherfuckin Bs on him
The more I swung the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasnt even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punching on the concrete
My mind is playing tricks on meI said a hip hop
The hip hip a hop and you dont stop a rock it
To the bang bang boogie say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie the beat

And when you come inside into the front
You do the freak spank and do the bump

Were a treacherous trio were the serious joint
aFrom sun to sun and from time to time
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
Ive created a devastating masterpiece
Im gonna rock the mic til you cant resist
Everybody I say it goes like this
Well I was walking home late one afternoon
A reporter stopped me for an interview
She said shes heard stories and shes heard fables
That Im vicious on the mic and the turntable
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before
She said Damn fly guy Im in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true
I said By the way baby whats your name
Said I go by name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman
I said Hes a fairy I do suppose
Flyin through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said You need a man man whos got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party til the early light
He cant satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it I go do it I go do it do it do it

You say if your girl starts actin up then you take her friend
I say skip dive what can I say

So I just tak half and bust em out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house
It was twelve oclock one Friday night
I was rockin to the beat and feelin all right
Everybody was dancin on the floor
Doin all the things they never did before
And then this fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar she came into the scene
She travelled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassoons
She came up to the table looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself its time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group you hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell you somethin were a helluva crew
Once a week were on the street
Just to cut in the jams and look at your feet
For you to party you gotta have the moves
So well get right down and get you a groove
For you to dance you got to be hot
So well get right down and make you rock
Now the systems on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rockin affair
But let me tell you somethin theres still one fact
And to have a party you got to have a rap
So when the partys over youre makin it home
And tryin to sleep before the break of dawn
And while youre sleepin you start to dream
And thinkin how you danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind
Yeah a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase Two just doin a do
Rockin you down cos you knew we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak
Come alive girls get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
Onnon into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin on right now
Hes garuanteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on Wonder Mike do what you like
I say a can of beer thats sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gamblin fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that dont taste good
Like a tree thats not made out of wood
Like goin up and not comin down
Is just like the beat without the sound no sound
To the beat beat you do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just aint no good
The macaronis soggy the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that youre full
And then your friend says Mama hes just being polite
He aint finished uhuh thats bull
So your heart starts pumpin and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says Man theres plenty of food
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky foods steamin your mind starts to dreamin
Of the moment that its time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say Thats it I gotta leave this place
I dont care what these people think
Im just sittin here makin myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
So you bust out the door while its still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says I understand about the food
Baby Bubba but were still friends
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop a you dont stop the rockin
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say Hank can ya rock
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just dont stop
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo
I said Come on make make the people move
I go to the balls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
A Big Bang I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said Sit down punk I wanna talk to you
And dont say a word until Im through
Now theres a time to laugh a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever you do in your lifetime
You never let an MC steal your rhyme
So from six to six til this very day
Ill always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that Im versatile
I got style finesse and a little black book
Thats filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But the thing that seperates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didnt even bite not a goword
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night

I grew up on the crime side the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
Had second hands moms bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth yo rockin the gold tooth Lo goose
Only way I begin to G off was drug loot
And lets start it like this son rollin with this one
And that one pullin out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smokin woolies at sixteen
And running up in gates and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough off
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better same damn Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick tight clique and went all out
Catchin keys from across seas
Rollin in MPVs every week we made forty Gs
Yo brothas respect mine or anger the tech nine

Its been 22 long hard years and still strugglin
Survival got me buggin but Im alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make CREAM
Which failed I went to jail at the age of 15
A young buck sellin drugs and such who never had much
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not touch
The court played me short now I face incarceration
Pacin going up states my destination
Handcuffed in back of a bus 40 of us
Life as a shorty shouldnt be so rough
But as the world turns I learned life is Hell
Living in the world no different from a cell
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin chase sellin base
Smokin bones in the staircase
Though I dont know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess thats the time when Im not depressed
But Im still depressed and I ask whats it worth
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth
Who explained working hard may help you maintain
to learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids corrupt cops and crack rocks
and stray shots all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be living proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shortys running wild smokin sess drinkin beer
And aint trying to hear what Im kickin in his ear

I wanna dedicate this one to the game that put me on the map
I know you love it the game is so irresistable to touch
You should see me when fienin for microphones that I can clutch
Droppin bombs combinin the club attracts
like the Ol Sugarhill Gang King Tim and Fatback
Theres no question the suggestion was made
The foundation was laid when the Furious played
Grandmaster Flash slayed the competition that was wishin
they could serve the technician with the number one position
Uhh the real deal Fearless Four scored
Bambataa was hotter Spoony was givin em nutta
An I was all up in my headzone melody and all
Cosign and The Movement sayin Yes yes yall
Its just the love affair that never ended
I recommended that I take microphones and blow em up aint that splendid
This one goes out to all the hiphop doordiers
A song is dedicated to the music I admire
We want you I need you
We want you do you feel the same way too
Kanes era was terror he warmed it up
Parrish and Erick cat lyrics thatll make ya turn it up
And I was in the cut chillin in my droptop Benz
with friends loungin with my mens laughin bout all the ends
that I spends making snaps pumping Kool G Rap and Biz
Dapper Don Dookie wrotes Im about to show what time it is
At the rooftop I was with Doug EFresh and Slick Rick
La Di Da Di Who likes to party was the fat shit
I mean I saw this hiphop thing on every level
Chuck D PE yes the rhythm and the rebel
I can reminisce the black fist Uzi Terminators
Terror doom techniques that terrorise the lighter shade
Its all about the game that we play everyday
Eric B Rakim flow to such a diffrent way
Im lovin hiphop cos it help brothers escape
Lets celebrate our music people before its too late
Survival Of The FittestMobb Deep and Lost Boyz
Lickin shots got the game hot
They even flipped on 2PAC
Snoop Doggy Dogg put the West Coast in gear
Dr Dre NWA Eazy Es in here
I wanna tell the world they just dont understand
My man Nas Escobar WuTang Clan
Keith Murray to the Redman down south Da Brat
My people are you with me where you atya peep that
Im on a mission to rejuvenate the funk
Bring the game back and give the doordiers what they want
When you hear Craig Mack Notorious BIG
Latifah Heavy D you should reminisce of me
Some say its Naughty By Naturehiphop in all its glory
A fleet of battleships floatin in diffrent categories
My love affair with hiphopll never fade away
Sincerely yours LL Cool J

Word bond Hiphop for life kid
YeahNow in my younger days I used to sport a shag
When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag
With an apple for my teacher cause I knew Id get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
help me with my problem it was never much
Just a trick to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man he was a thug
His name was Lee he drove a Z
hed pick her up from school promptly at three oclock
I was on her jock yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus
First Id write her name then carve a plus
with my name last on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass
She keeps on passin me by
When I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly
See shes my type of hype and I cant stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a gogetter
I havent gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
Im shootin for her heart got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad and I could be her
But all I can do is stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now shes more sophisticated highly edumacated
not at all overrated I think I need a prayer
to get in her boots and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although shes crazy steppin Ill try to stop her stride
Cause I wont have no more of this passin me by
Time for me to voice my opinion of not even pretendin she didnt have me
Strung like a chicken chase my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star thinking I was like a fan
Dude she looked good down side she had a man
He was a rootytoot a nincompoop
She told me soon your little birdies gonna fly the coop
She was a flake like corn and I was born not to understand
By lettin her pass I had proved to be a better man
She keeps on passin me by
Now there she goes again the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me be gets movin in slow motion
whenever she happens to walk by why does the apple of my eye
overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try
Wait no i did not really pursue my little princess with persistance
And I was so lowkey that she was unaware of my existance
From a distance I desired secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her and it went
My dear my dear my dear you do not know me but I know you very well
Now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you
When I try or make some sort of attempt I symp
Damn I wish I wasnt such a wimp
Cause then I would let you know that I love you so
And if I was your man then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you
Then I signed sincerely the one who loves you dearly PS love me tender
The letter came back three days later Return to Sender
She keeps on passin me byNow heres a little story Ive got to tell
About three bad brothers you know so well
It started way back in history
With Adrock MCA and me Mike D
Been had a little horsy named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsy and a quart of beer
Riding across the land kicking up sand
Sheriffs posse on my tail cause Im in demand
One lonely Beastie I be
All by myself without nobody
The sun is beating down on my baseball hat
The air is gettin hot the beer is getting flat
Lookin for a girl I ran into a guy
His name is MCA I said Howdy he said Hi
He told a little story that sounded well rehearsed
Four days on the run and that hes dying of thirst
The brew was in my hand and he was on my tip
His voice was hoarse his throat was dry he asked me for a sip
He said Can I get some
I said You cant get none
Had a chance to run
He pulled out his shotgun
He was quick on the draw I thought Id be dead
He put the gun to my head and this is what he said
Now my name is MCA Ive got a license to kill
I think you know what time it is its time to get ill
Now what do we have here an outlaw and his beer
I run this land you understand I make myself clear
We stepped into the wind he had a gun I had a grin
You think this storys over but its ready to begin
Now I got the gun you got the brew
You got two choices of what you can do
Its not a tough decision as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me I said Ill ride with you if you can get me to the border
The sheriffs after me for what I did to his daughter
I did it like this I did it like that
I did it with a whiffleball bat
So Im on the run the cops got my gun
And right about now its time to have some fun
The King Adrock that is my name
And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne
We rode for six hours then we hit the spot
The beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot
This dude was staring like he knows who we are
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar
MCA said Yo you know this kid
I said I didnt but I know he did
The kid said Get ready cause this aint funny
My names Mike D and Im about to get money
Pulled out the jammy aimed it at the sky
He yelled Stick em up and let two fly
Hands went up and people hit the floor
He wasted two kids that ran for the door
Im Mike D and I get respect
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect
MCA was with it and hes my ace
So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face
The piano players out the music stopped
His boy had beef and he got dropped
Mike D grabbed the money MCA snatched the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a beer thats coldWord up son word
yeah to all the killers and a hundred dollar billas
for real niggas who aint got no feelings
I got you stuck off the realness we be the infamous
the Mobb comes equipped with warfare beware
of my crime family who got nuff shots to share
for all of those who wanna profile and pose
rock you in your face stab your brain wit your nosebone
you all alone in these streets cousin
every man for theirself in this land we be gunnin
and keep them shook crews runnin
they come around but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face
youre in the wrong place
cowards like you just get theyre whole body laced up
with bullet holes and such
speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
you can put your whole army against my team and
I guarantee you itll be your very last time breathin
your simple words just dont move me
you all up in the game and dont deserve to be a player
dont make me have to call your name out
my gunshotsll make you levitate
Im only nineteen but my mind is old
and when the things get for real my warm heart turns cold
another nigga deceased another story gets told
hey yo dun spark the Phillie
so I can get my mind off these yellowbacked niggas
why they still alive I dont know go figure
meanwhile back in Queens the realness is foundation
if I die I couldnt choose a better location
when the slugs penetrate you feel a burning sensation
getting closer to God in a tight situation
now take these words home and think it through
or the next rhyme I write might be about you
cause aint no such things as halfway crooks
scared to death scared to look
cause aint no such things as halfway crooks
scared to death scared to look
livin the live that of diamonds and guns
theres numerous ways you can choose to earn fundsearn funds
some of em get shot locked down and turn nuns
cowardly hearts end straight up shook onesshook ones
he aint a crook son hes just a shook oneshook one
For every rhyme I write its 25 to life
yo its a must the gats we trust safeguardin my life
aint no time for hesitation
that only leads to incarceration
you dont know me theres no relation
I dont got time for your petty thinking mind
son Im bigga than those claimin that you pack heat
but youre scared to hold
and when the smoke clears youll be left with one in your dome
13 years in the projects my mentality is what kid
you talk a good one but you dont want it
sometimes I wonder do I deserve to live
or am I going to burn in hell for all the things I did
no time to dwell on that cause my brain reacts
front if you want kid lay on your back
I dont fake jacks kid you know I bring it to you live
stay in a childs place kid you out o line
criminal minds thirsty for recognition
Im sippin EJ got my mind flippin
Im buggin think Im how bizar to hold my hustlin
get that loot kid you know my function
cause long as Im alive Ima live illegal
and once I get on Ima put on on my people
react mix to lyrics like Macs I hit your dome up
when I roll up dont be caught sleepin
cause aint no such things as halfway crooks
scared to death and scared to look
cause aint no such things as halfway crooks
scared to death and scared to look
cause aint no such things as halfway crooks
scared to death and scared to look
cause aint no such things as halfway crooks crooks
livin the live that of diamonds and guns
theres numerous ways you can choose to earn fundsearn funds
but some of em get shot locked down and turn nuns
cowardly hearts end straight up shook onesshook ones
he aint a crook son hes just a shook oneshook one
To all the villains and a hundred dollar billas
To real brothers who aint got no dealings
Gyeah the whole Bridge Queens get the money
Beats by SuPrimo for all of my peoples negroes and latinos
Yo check it one for Charlie Hustle two for Steady Rock
Three for the fourth comin live future shock
Its five dimensions six senses
Seven firmaments of heaven to hell 8 Million Stories to tell
Nine planets faithfully keep in orbit
with the probable tenth the universe expands length
The body of my text posess extra strength
Powerliftin powerless up out of this towerin inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
Im blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
HipHop past all your tall social hurdles
like the nationwide projects prisonindustry complex
Broken glass wall better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom sing
Say evacuate your sleep its dangerous to dream
but you chain cats get they CHAPOW who dead now
Killin fields need blood to graze the cash cow
Its a number game but shit dont add up somehow
Like I got sixteen to thirtytwo bars to rock it
but only 15 of profits ever see my pockets like
sixtynine billion in the last twenty years
spent on national defense but folks still live in fear like
nearly half of Americas largest cities is onequarter black
Thats why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
Sixteen ounces to a pound twenty more to a ki
A five minute sentence hearing and you no longer free
40 of Americans own a cell phone
so they can hear everything that you say when you aint home
I guess Michael Jackson was right You Are Not Alone
Rock your hardhat black cause you in the Terrordome
full of hard niggaz large niggaz dice tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facin life numbers
Crack mothers crack babies and AIDS patients
Young bloods cant spell but they could rock you in PlayStation
This new math is whippin motherfuckers ass
You wanna know how to rhyme you better learn how to add
Its simple mathematics
What are we talking about here
Do your math
One tttwo three four
What are we talking about here
Yo its one universal law but two sides to every story
Three strikes and you be in for life manditory
Four MCs murdered in the last four years
I aint tryin to be the fifth one the millenium is here
Yo its 6 Million Ways to Die from the seven deadly thrills
Eightyear olds gettin found with 9 mills
Its 10 PM where your seeds at Whats the deal
He on the hill puffin krill to keep they belly filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers tryin to earn they next stripe
When the average minimum wage is 515
You best believe you gotta find a new ground to get cream
The white unemployment rate is nearly more than triple for black
so frontliners got they gun in your back
Bubblin crack jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
and end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still livin
join the other five million under state supervision
This is business no faces just lines and statistics
from your phone your zip code to SSI digits
The system break man child and women into figures
Two columns for who is and who aint niggaz
Numbers is hardly real and they never have feelings
but you push too hard even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camels back Heres the secret
the million other straws underneath it its all mathematics
La di da di la di da di
You know what you peep this
La di da di we like to party
We dont cause trouble we dont bother nobody
Were just some men thats on the mic
And when we rock upon the mic
We rock the mic
For all a yall keepin yall in health
Just to see ya smile and enjoy yaself
Cause its cool when you cause a cozy conditionin
That we create so thats our mission so listen
To what we say because this type of shit happens everyday
I woke up around ten oclock in the mornin
Gave myself a a mornin yawn and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
Had some soap on my face and my hand upon the cup
I said a on the wall
Who is the top choice of them all
There was a rumble dumble
Five minutes it lasted the mirror said
Yo thats true thats why we never have no beef
So then I washed off the soap and brushed the gold teeth
Used Oil of Olay cause my skin gets pale
Then I got the files for my fingernails
True to the style on my behalf
I put the bubbles in the tub so I could have a bubble bath
Clean dry was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new Gucci underwear
For all the girls I might take home
I got the Johnsons Baby Powder and the
Fresh dressed like a millions bucks threw on the Valley shoes
And the fly green socks
Stepped out the house stopped short oh no
I went back in I forgot the
Then I dilly ran through a
Bumped into my old girl from the
This was a girl playing hard to get
So I said Whats wrong cause she looked upset
And now my life is filled with rainy days
And I love you so how much youll never know
Cause you took your love away from me
Now what was I to do
She was crying over me and she was feeling blue
I said Dont cry
Here comes your mother with those two little guys
Her mean mother steps and says to me
Hit Sally in the face and decked her in the
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong the kids was gone
Something was wrong I said what was going on
I tried to break it up I said stop it leave her
She said If I cant have you
She grabbed me closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out like I had the chicken pox
But uh she gave chase she caught up quick
She put a finger in the face of MC Rick and said
So we can go cruising in my OJ and what
Ill give you all my love today
What Ricky Ricky Ricky what
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Yo MC Rick my love is here to stay
And on and on and on she kept on
The bitch been around before my mothers born
I said Cheer up I gave her a kiss
I said You cant have me Im too young for you miss
She said No youre not then she starts crying
I says Im thirtyfour she says
I said I am go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy I cant be your lover
To the tick tock and you dont stopf
To the tick tick ya dont hit it
Doug E Fresh yall give him a round of applause yall
Yea what upAh yeah heres another Gangstarr sure shot featuring the one and

Peace out Premier take me out wit da fader
I chant eenie meenie minie moe
I wreck da mic like a pimp pimps hoes
Heres how it goes I am a genius I mean this
I shake this youll take this
You wish that you could come into my neighborhood
Still Im 5 foot 8
Crazy as I wanna be
Cause I make it orderly
You could say Im sorta da boss so get lost
The brotha dat will make you change opinions
Dominions Im in them when its time to kick shit from
The heart plus I get a piece of the action
Im feelin satisfaction from the street crowd reaction
Chumps pull guns when they feel afraid too late
When they dip in the kick they get sprayed
Lemonade was a popular drink and in still is
I get more props den stunts den Bruce Willis
A poet like Langston Hughes and cant lose when I cruise
Leavin the Bodega I say suave
Premiers got more beats den barns got hay
Clips are inserted into my gun
So I can take the money neva have ta run
I left my Phillie at home
I wanna get blunted my brother
Now may I make a mark
Then make a spark over this phat track
Or should I say dope beat
All of the wick wack that wanna be abstract
But they lack the new knack thats comin from way way back
Hey yo Premier please pass that buddha sack
I told ya before we come back wit more hits
I provide bright flava so you could sketch me
Do me a favor dont try and catch me
Slightly ahead of the game Im not a lame
Ask him hell tell you the same he knows my name
Smooth I drop jewels like paraphenalia
Im infallable not into failure
Like a rhinocerus my speed is prosperous
And pure knowledge expands from my esophagus
I write here tonite to bring truth to the light
My dialogue is my own cause Smooth B will neva bite Kray Lay
You know how we used to get that vibe back in the day

When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought Id see her face
Aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place
Suspended from school and scared to go home I was a fool
with the big boys breakin all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddys the same drama
When things went wrong wed blame mama
I reminice on the stress I caused it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And whod think in elementary
Heeey I see the penitentiary one day
And runnin from the police thats right
Mama catch me put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend mama
You always was a black queen mama
for a woman it aint easy tryin to raise a man
A poor single mother on welfare tell me how ya did it
Theres no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
Dont cha know we love ya Sweet lady
Place no one above ya sweet lady
Dont cha know we love ya
Now aint nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasnt there
He passed away and I didnt cry cause my anger
wouldnt let me feel for a stranger
They say Im wrong and Im heartless but all along
I was lookin for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I aint guilty cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rents due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you comin home after work late
Youre in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
Ya just workin with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin
But now the road got rough youre alone
Youre tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And theres no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
Pour out some liquor and I reminsce cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that Im hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act craaazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night theres a brighter day
Everything will be alright if ya hold on
Its a struggle everyday gotta roll on
And theres no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
Lady So what you gonna do cat daddy
I dont know dawgjuss trying to live it one day at a time
I hear you man live it one day at a time
Let me get up outta here man my ride waitin
Aiight cat daddy stay tru
He greets his father with his hands out
Rehabilitated slightly glad to be the mans child
The world is different since hes seen it last
Out of jail in seven years and hes happy that hes free at last
All he had was his mothers worth
Now shes gone and hes gotta make a change and make it for the beddah
But hes back so hes got one strike against him
And hes young plus he came up in the system
But hes smart and hes finally makin eighteen
And this goes to get on top and try to stay clean
So hes calling up his homie who dun came up
Livin like this now they dealin with the same stuff
And had that attitude that who he was was worth it
and with that fucked up attitude he killed his first mate
Now its different and hes dead as dirt
And realized that the name aint coming up but it still hurt
And caint nobody change this
Its ninteenninetyfoe and we up against the same shit
I could nevah seen a man cry til i seen that man die
Imagine life at its full peak
Then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy
Imagine peace on this earth when theres no grief
Imagine grief on this earth when theres no peace
Cuz everybodys got a different way of endin it
And when your number comes for service then they send it in
Now your time has arrived for the final touch
I see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath
How much longeer will it be til its all done
Total darkness and ease be in all one
I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate
You took his life but your memory hell never take
Youll be heade to another place
And the life you used to live will reflect in your mothers face
I hear you breathin but your heart no longer sounds strong
But you kinda scared of dying so you hold on
And you keep on blacking out cuz the post is near
Stop trying to fight the reaper just relax and let it go
Because theres no way you can fight it but youll still try
And you can try it til you fight it but youll still die
Now your spirit leaves your body and your mind clears
The rigormortis starts to set now you outta here
You start your journey into outer space
You see yourself in the light but youre still feeling outta place
So you standing in the tunnel of eternal light
And you see the ones you never learn to love in life
Make the choice let it go but u can back it up
If you aint at peace with God you need to patch it up
But if you ready close your eyes and we can set it free
There lies a man not scared to die may he rest in peace
I still got to wondah why
I never seen a man cry til I seen a man die
hope you feel beddahAttention please attention please

A truck full of crap rental car from Avis

Well momma I know I act a fool
But Ill be gone til November I got packs to move I Hope
God show me the way because the Devil trying to break me down
The only thing that that I pray is that my feet dont fail me now
And I dont think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
I want to talk to God but Im afraid because we aint spoke in so long
To the hustlers killers murderers drug dealers even the strippers
To the victims of Welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
Cause were the almost nearly extinct
We rappers are role models we rap we dont think
I aint here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
Im just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis thats the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns sex lies video tapes
But if I talk about God my record wont get played Huh
Well let this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that Im dreaming about
Next time Im in the club everybody screaming out
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
The only thing that that I pray is that my feet dont fail me now
And I dont thing theres nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
I want to talk to God but Im afraid because we aint spoke in so longAh push it
Now wait a minute yall
This dance aint for everybody
So all you fly mothers get on out there and dance
Salt and Pepas here and were in effect

Cmon girls lets go show the guys that we know
How to become number one in a hot party show
Ah push it push it good
Ah push it push it real good
Ah push it push it good
Ah push it ppush it real good
Yo yo yo yo babypop
Yeah you come here gimme a kiss
Better make it fast or else Im gonna get pissed
Cant you hear the musics pumpin hard like I wish you would
Boy you really got me going
You got me so I dont know what Im doing
Ah push itIm rated Rthis is a warning ya better void
Poets are paranoid DJs Dstroyed
Cuz I came back to attack others in spite
Strike like lightnin Its quite frightenin
But dont be afraid in the dark in a park
Not a scream or a cry or a bark more like a spark
Ya tremble like a alcoholic muscles tighten up
Whats that lighten up You see a sight but
Suddenly you feel like your in a horror flick
You grab your heart then wish for tomorrow quick
Musics the clue when I come your warned
Apocolypse Now when Im done ya gone
Havent you ever heard of a MCmurderer
This is the death penaltyand Im servin a
death wish so come on step to this
hysterical idea for a lyrical professionist
Friday the thirteenth walking down Elm Street
you come in my realm ya get beat
This is off limits so your visions are blurry
All ya see is the meters at a volume
Terror in the styles never errorfiles
For those that oppose to be level or next to this
I aint a devil and this aint the Exorcist
worse than a nightmare you dont have to sleep a wink
the pains a migraine every time ya think
Flashbacks interfere ya start to hear
The RAKIM in your ear
Then the beat is hysterical
that makes Eric go get a ax and chops the wack
soon the lyrical format is superior
faces of death remain
MCs decaying cuz they never stayed
the scene of a crime every night at the show
the fiend of a rhyme on the mic that you know
Its only one capable breaksthe unbreakable
a horn if want the style I posses
I bless the child the earth the gods and bomb the rest
for those that envy a MC it can be
hazardous to your health so be friendly
a matter of life and death just like a ethchasketch
shake till your clear make it disappear make the next
after the ceremony let the rhyme rest in peace
if not my soulll release
the scene is recreated reincarnated updated Im glad you made it
cuz your about to see a disasterous sight
a performance never again performed on a mic
the R is in the housetoo much tension
Make sure the systems loud when I mention
You want to hear some sounds that not only pounds but please your eardrums
I sit back and observe the whole scenery
then nonchalantly tell you what it mean to me
strictly business Im quickly in this mood
and I dont care if the whole crowds a witness
Im a tear you apart but Im a spare you a heart
program into the speed of the rhyme prepare to start
rhythms out of the radius insane as the craziest
musical madness MC ever made see its
now an emergency openheart surgery
open your mind you will find every wordll be
furier than ever I remain the furture
For words the sentence theres no resemblance
you think youre ruffer then suffer the consequences
I wake ya with hundreds of thousands of volts
mictomouth resuscitation rhythm with radiation
novicane ease the pain it might save him
if not Eric Bs the judge the crowds the jury
How do I plead to homicide
theyre getting furier a fearified freestyleArmy with harmony
Dave drop a load on em

Many men many many many many men

Im the diamond in the dirt that aint been found
Im the underground king and I aint been crowned
When I rhyme something special happen every time
Im the greatest something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
Ive been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga gohead lose your head
Turn your back on me get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on my waist chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face pussy this beef aint over
Many men many many many many men
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many many many many men
Sunny days wouldnt be special if it wasnt for rain
Joy wouldnt feel so good if it wasnt for pain
Death gotta be easy cause life is hard
Itll leave you physically mentally and emotionally scarred
This if for my niggas on the block twisting trees and cigars
For the niggas on lock doing life behind bars
I dont see only god can judge me cause I see things clear
Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years
Im like Paulie in Goodfellas you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool why you want me to die homie
Many men many many many many men
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many many many many men
Every night I talk to god but he dont say nothing back
I know he protecting me but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares niggas keep pulling techs on me
Psych says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didnt know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tuck got knocked
I aint gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate nigga You cant read between the lines
In the bible it says what goes around comes around
Hommo shot me three weeks later he got shot down
Now its clear that Im here for a real reason
Cause he got hit like I got hit but he aint fucking breathing
Many men many many many many men
Lord I dont cry no more

Black people unite now hop up and do it right
Black people unite now come on and do it right
Yeah baby thats what I like
Yeah baby thats what I like
Yeah baby thats what I likeIm making short term goals wonder whether foes
just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
chilly with enough bail money to free a big Willy
high stakes I got more at stake than Philly
shopping sprees coping three deuce fever I guess its fully loaded
bouncing in the lex luger tires smoke like Buddha
50 gs to the crap shooter
chrome socks beaming through my peripheral I see ya scheming
stop dreamin I leave ya body steaming
niggas is feening whats the meaning
Im leaning on any nigga intervening with the sound of my money machinein
my cuff running over with hundreds
Im one of the best niggas that done it
yall niggas dont want it
I got the godfather flow the don Juan Demarco
swear to god dont get it fucked up
to give you a piece of my mind
but though you think you are
baby one day youll be a star
last seen out of state where I drop my slang
Im deep in the south kicking up top game
bouncing on the highway switching 4 lanes
screaming through the sun roof money aint a thang
me and my fam roll tight like the firm
getting down for life thats right you better learn
why play with fire burn
we get together like a choir
to acquire what we desire
we do dirt like worms
til legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes with expensive clothes
and I sip wine and spit vintage flows
cause you cant knock the hustle
but until that day then
Im the one whose crazy
cause thats the way ya making me feel
Im just trying to get mine
I dont have the time
to knock the hustle for real
yall niggas lunching punching a clock
my function is lo make much n lay back munching
sipping Remy on rocks my crew
something to watch nothing to stop
scheme on the ice I gotta hide your crew
let you niggas know the time like movado
bottle off the champagne crystals by the bottle
its a damn shame what youre not though me slick like a GATO fuckin JayZ
pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
can a nigga see me
got the US Open advantage jigga
serve like sampras play fake a rappers like a campus Le Tigre
you aint having it good me either
lets get together and make this whole world believers
all these blacks got is sports and entertainment until we even
thieving as long as Im breathing
cant knock the way a nigga eating
to give you a piece of my mind
but though you think you are
baby one day youll be a star
but until that day then
Im the one whose crazy
cause thats the way ya making me feel
Im just trying to get mine I dont have the time
to knock the hustle for realThe revolution will not be televised
Yeah its Common Sense with DJ Premier
We gonna help yall see clear
Its real hiphop music from the soul yall
The perseverence of a rebel I drop heavier levels
Its unseen or heard a king with words
Cant knock the hustle but Ive seen street dreams deferred
Dark spots in my mind where the scene occured
Some say Im too deep Im in too deep to sleep
Through me Muhammed will forever speak
Greet brothers with handshakes in ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined by how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
with cigarettes in their ear niggerish they appear
Under the Fubu is a guru thats untapped
Want to be in the rap race but aint ran one lap
Ran so far from the streets that you cant come back
You tripping with nowhere to unpack forgot that
This is rap for real something you feel
And you know yes you know
Rap for the black people
In front of twoinch glass and Arabs I order fries
Inspiration when I write I see my daughters eyes
Im the truth across the table from corporate lies
Immortilized by the realness I bring to it
If revolution had a movie Id be theme music
My music you either fight fuck or dream to it
My life is one big rhyme I try to scheme through it
Through my shell never knew what the divine would bring to it
Id be lying if I said I didnt want millions
More than money saved I wanna save children
Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
This industry will make you lose intensity
The Common Sense in me remembers the basement
Im Morpheus in this hiphop Matrix exposing fake shit
Somedays I take the L to gel with the real world
Got on at 87th stopped by this little girl
She recited raps I forgot where they was from
In em she was saying how she made brothers cum
I start thinking how many souls hiphop has affected
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge ones perspective
Though some of that shit yall pop true it I aint relating
If I dont like it I dont like it that dont mean that Im hating
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know Im with em
For now I appreciate this moment in time
Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes its likeHeah hah hah
Im serious nigga one of yall niggaz got this ass motherfuckin up
Aiy baby aiy baby aiy baby get some bubblegum in this motherfucker
Steady long steady long nigga
With so much drama in the LBC
Its kinda hard bein Snoop DOdoubleG
But I somehow some way
Keep comin up with funky ass shit like every single day
May I kick a little something for the Gs
and make a few ends as I breeze through
Two in the mornin and the partys still jumpin
cause my momma aint home
I got bitches in the living room gettin it on
and they aint leavin til six in the mornin
So what you wanna do sheeeit
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But we dont love them hoes yeah
So we gonna smoke a ounce to this
Gs up hoes down while you motherfuckers bounce to this
Rollin down the street smokin indo sippin on gin and juice
Now that I got me some Seagrams gin
Everybody got they cups but they aint chipped in
Now this types of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listenin to the DOG
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
and get to mackin to this bitch named Sadie
She used to be the homeboys lady
Eighty degrees when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these NUTs cause you gets none of these
At ease as I mob with the Dogg Pound feel the breeze
My homey Dr Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic that made me choke
Shit this aint no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic yeah Im fucked up now
But it aint no stoppin Im still poppin
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me not with a cherry on top
Cause when I bust my nut Im raisin up off the cot
Dont get upset girl thats just how it goes
I dont love you hoes Im out the do
Rollin down the street smokin indo sippin on gin and juice
Rollin down the street smokin indo sippin on gin and juice
Laid back You know parents are the same no matter time nor place
They dont understand that us kids are gonna make some mistakes
So to you all the kids all across the land
Theres no need to argue parents just dont understand
My mom took me school shopping
It was me my brother my mom oh my pop and my little sister
All hopped in the car
We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall
MY mom started bugging with the clothes she chose
I didnt say nothing at first
I just turned up my nose
She said Whats wrong This shirt cost 20
I said Mom this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar
The next half hour was the same old thing
My mother buying me clothes from 1963
And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips
I said Mom what are you doing youre ruining my rep
She said Youre only sixteen you dont have a rep yet
I said Mom lets put these clothes back please
She said no you go to school to learn not for a fashion show
I said This isnt Sha Na Na come on Mom Im not Bowzer
Mom please put back the bellbottom Brady Bunch trousers
But if you dont want to I can live with that but
You gotta put back the doubleknit reversible slacks
She wasnt moved everything stayed the same
Inevitably the first day of school came
I thought I could get over I tried to play sick
But my mom said No no way uhuh forget it
There was nothing I could do I tried to relax
I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
And when I walked into school it was just as I thought
The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought
And those who werent laughing still had a ball
Because they were pointing and whispering
As I walked down the hall
I got home and told my Mom how my day went
She said If they were laughing you dont need them
Cause theyre not good friends
For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom
That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times
So to you all the kids all across the land
Theres no need to argue
My parents went away on a weeks vacation and
They left the keys to the brand new Porsche
Umm well of course not
Ill just take it for a little spin
And maybe show it off to a couple of friends
Ill just cruise it around the neighborhood
Yeah of course I should
Pay attention heres the thick of the plot
I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
Thats when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking
I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking
You shouldve seen this girls bodily dimensions
I honked my horn just to get her attention
She said Was that for me
I said Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy
She said How do I know youre not sick
You could be some deranged lunatic
I said Cmon toots my name is the Prince
Beside would a lunatic have a Porsche like this
She agreed and we were on our way
She was looking very good and so was I I must say word
We hit McDonalds pulled into the drive
We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes
She kicked her shoes off onto the floor
She said Drive fast speed turns me on
She put her hand on my knee I put my foot on the gas
We almost got whiplash I took off so fast
The sun roof was open the music was high
And this girls hand was steadily moving up my thigh
She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far
I guess thats why I didnt notice that police car
Were doing ninety in my Moms new Porsche
And to make this long story short short
When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell
I said I dont have a license but I drive very well officer
I almost had a heart attack that day
Come to find out the girl was a twelveyearold runaway
I was arrested the car was impounded
There was no way for me to avoid being grounded
My parents had to come off from vacation to get me
Id rather be in jail than to have my father hit me
I got my grip I said Ah Mom Dad how was your trip
They didnt speak I said I want to plead my case
But my father just shoved me in the car by my face
That was a hard ride home I dont know how I survived
They took turns one would beat me while the other was driving
I cant believe it I just made a mistake
Well parents are the same no matter time nor place
So to you all the kids all across the land
Take it from me parents just dont understandYo pay attention
And listen real closely how I break this slang shit down
Check it my weed smoke is my lye
A ki of coke is supply
When Im lifted Im high
With new clothes on Im fly
Cars is whips and sneakers is kicks
Money is chips movies is flicks
Also cribs is homes jacks is pay phones
Cocaine is nose candy cigarettes is bones
A radio is a box a razor blade is a ox
Fat diamonds is rocks and jakes is cop
And if you got rubbed you got stuck
You got shot you got bucked
And if you got doublecrossed you got fucked
Your bankroll is your poke a choke hold is a yoke
A kite is a note a con is a okey doke
And if you got punched that mean you got snuffed
To clean is to buff a bull scare is a strong bluff
I know you like the way Im freakin it
I talk with slang and Im a never stop speakin it
Speak with criminal slang
Thats just the way that I talk yo
Vocabulary spills Im ill
A burglary is a jook a woofs a crook
Mobb Deep already explained the meanin of shook
If you caught a felony you caught a F
If you got killed you got left
If you got the dragon you got bad breath
If you 730 that mean you crazy
Hit me on the hip means page me
Angel dust is sherm if you got AIDS you got the germ
If a chick gave you a disease then you got burned
Max mean to relax guns and pistols is gats
Condoms is hats critters is cracks
The food you eat is your grub
A sweat box is a small club your tick is your heart
Your apartment is your pad
Your old man is your dad
The studio is the lab and heated is mad
I know you like the way Im freakin it
I talk with slang and Im a never stop speakin it
The iron horse is the train and champaign is bubbly
A deuce is a honey thats ugly
If your girl is fine shes a dime
A suit is a fine jewelry is shine
If you in love that mean you blind
Genuine is real a face card is a hundred dollar bill
A very hard long stare is a grill
If you sneakin to go see a girl that mean you creepin
Smilin is cheesin bleedin is leakin
Beggin is bummin if you nuttin you comin
Takin orders is sunnin an ounce of coke is a onion
A hotels a telly a cell phones a celly
Jealous is jelly your food box is your belly
To guerrilla mean to use physical force
You took a L you took a loss
To show off mean floss uh
I know you like the way Im freakin it
I talk with slang and Im a never stop speakin it
One love to my big brother Big Lee
Yeah yeah Flamboyant for lifeCmon man
And with the local DBT news LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback
Dont call it a comeback

Rockin my peers and puttin suckas in fear
Makin the tears rain down like a MONsoon
Listen to the bass go BOOM
Over the competition Im towerin
Wreckin shop when I drop these lyrics thatll make you call the cops
Dont you dare stare you betta move

Mama said knock you out
Dont u call this a regular jam

Cuz u know I had beef wit
Why do u riff with me the maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready cuz it might go
BLAAAAW how ya like me now
The river will not allow
U to get with Mr Smith dont riff
Listen to my gear shift
Kinda like Shaft so u could say Im shaftin
Old English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme
Shadow boxin when I heard you on the radio
What made you forget that I was raw
But now I got a new tour
Im goin insane startin the hurricane releasin pain
Lettin you know that you cant gain I maintain
Unless ya say my name
Diggin and drillin a hole
When I rip and kill at WILL
The man of the hour tower of power Ill devour
Im gonna tie you up and let you understand
That Im not your average man
When I got a jammy in my hand
Listen to the way I slaaaaay your crew
Damage damage damage damage
Pass me a sissy so suckas Ill slay him
I think Im gonna bomb a town
Dont u neva eva pull my lever
And my nine is easy to load
Cuz he gave me the strength to rock
HARD knock you out mama said knock you outIts another one of them ol funky Cypress Hill things
And it goes like thisss
Hey dont miss out on what your passin
Youre missin the hoota of the funky Buddha
Eluder or the fucked up styles to get wicked
So come on as cypress starts to kick it
Cuz were like the outlaw stridin
Jump behind the bush when they see me driving
And my magnum takin out some putos
Kid from from the street getting paid for my
Here is something you cant understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you cant understand
How I could just kill a man
Verse Two Sen Dog BeReal
I been doin all the dumb shit
yo because I bet its comin from it
Im not gonna waste no time
fuckin around like I got ya hummin
And you know I had to gat ya
Time for some action just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
into your sattelite shinin a battle light
swing out the gat and I know that will gat ya right
Heres an example just a little sample
How I could just kill a man
Onetime tried to come in my home
take my chrome I said Yo its on
Take cover son or youre assout
How you like my chrome then I watched the rookie pass out
Didnt have to blast him but I did anyway
Hahaha that young punk had to pay
So I just killed a man
Its gonna be a long time before I finish
one of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff ignite ya with these sights
and if you aint down bullshit
Say some punk try to get you for your auto
Would you call the onetime play the role model
No I think you play like a thug
Next hear the shot of a magnum slug
yeah ya know Im gonna gat ya
How you know where Im at when you havent been where Ive been
understand where Im coming from
When youre up on the hill in your big home
Im out here risking my dome
Just for a bucket or a fast ducat
just to stay alive aiyyo I gotta say fuck it
Here is something you cant understand
How I could just kill a man
All I wanted was a PepsiSo whats up man
Yo you know I had to call you know why right
Because yo I never ever call and ask you to play something right
You know what I wanna hear right
I wanna hear that WuTang joint
Ah yeah again and again
WuTang Clan coming at you protect your neck kid so set it off the Inspector Deck
watch your step kid
I smoke on the mic like smoking Joe Frazier
The hell raiser raising hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swinging through your town like your neighborhood Spiderman
So uhh tic toc and keep ticking
While I get you flipping off the shit Im kicking
The Lone Ranger code red danger
Deep in the dark with the art to rip charts apart
The vandal too hot to handle
you battle youre saying Goodbye like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck Inspector Decks on the set
The rebel I make more noise than heavy metal
The way I make the crowd go wild sit back relax wont smile
Rae got it going on pal call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And Im gonna get mad deep like a threat blow up your project
Then take all your assets
Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip go flip on the next man
Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with sixteen shots and more I got
Going to war with the melting pot hot
Its the Method Man for short Mr Meth
Moving on your left ah
And set it off get it off let it off like a gat
I wanna break full cock me back
Small change they putting shame in the game
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
And like Fame my stylell live forever
Niggaz crossing over but they dont know no better
But I do true can I get a sue
Nuff respect due to the onesixoh
I mean oh you check out the flow
like the Hudson or PCP when Im dusting
Niggaz off because Im hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt makes me
Oh what grab my nut get screwed
Ow here comes my Shaolin style
Sloop B A BuhB Y U
to my crew with the sue
watch your step kid
cmon baby baby cmon
Yo you best protect your neck
First things first man youre fucking with the worst
Ill be sticking pins in your head like a fucking nurse
Ill attack any nigga whos slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you stepped through to
The Ol Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And Ill be damned if I let any man
Come to my center you enter the winter
Straight up and down that shit packed jam
You cant slam dont let me get fool on him man
The Ol Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinking
Ason unique rolling with the night of the creeps
Niggaz be rolling with a stash
aint saying cash bite my style Ill bite your motherfucking ass
For crying out loud my style is wild so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejecting styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Heres Mordigan catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats if rap was a gun you wouldnt bust back
I come with shit thats all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stomping grounds
I give a order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shooting star
cause who I am is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Point blank as I kick the square biz
There it is youre fucking with pros and there it goes
You chill with the feedback black we dont need that
Its ten oclock hoe where the fucks your seed at
Feeling mad hostile ran the apostle
Flowing like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll then attack the globe with the buckus style
the ruckus ten times ten men committing mad sin
Turn the other cheek and Ill break your fucking chin
Slaying boombangs like African drums
Coming around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Tuhtook a genius take us the fuck outta here
The Wu is too slamming for these Cold Killing labels
Some aint had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doing artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they moneys gettin stuck to the gum under the table
Thats what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For trying to blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20watt light bulb
Shouldve pumped it when I rocked it
Niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors theyre scared to death to pump these
First of all whos your AR
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
But he dont know the meaning of dope
When hes looking for a suit and tie rap
thats cleaner than a bar of soap
And Im the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact bring out the girls and lets have a mud fight
You best protect your neck Break em off somethin
Just wakin up in the mornin gotta thank God
I dont know but today seems kinda odd
No barkin from the dog no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on but didnt pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the do
Thinkin will I live another twentyfo
I gotta go cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and Im askin yall
Which park are yall playin basketball
Get me on the court and Im trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin niggaz everyway like MJ
I cant believe today was a good day
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didnt even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin didnt even look in a niggas direction
as I ran the intersection
Went to hort Dogs house they was watchin Yo MTV Raps
Whats the haps on the craps
Shake em up shake em up shake em up shake em
Roll em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break em
with the seven seveneleven seveneleven
Seven even back do Lil Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones and Im yellin domino
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day
Left my niggas house paid
Picked up a girl been tryin to fuck since the 12th grade
Its ironic I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punanny
And my dick runs deep so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didnt hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and Im coastin
Took another sip of the potion hit the threewheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didnt even see a berry flashin those high beams
No helicopter looking for a murder
Two in the mornin got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read Ice Cubes a pimp
Drunk as hell but no throwin up
Half way home and my pager still blowin up
Today I didnt even have to use my AK
I got to say it was a good day
Hey wait wait a minute Pooh stop this shit
What the fuck Im thinkin aboutHow about some hardcore
For the fellas on the corner posted up 20 deep
With your ifth on your hip ready to flip
Whenever you empty your clip dip trip your sidekick
You got skill you best manage to chill
And do yourself a favor dont come nowhere near the Hill
With that bullshit word money grip itll cost ya
Make you reminisce of Frank Nitty The Enforcer
I move with MOPs Last Generation
Straight up and down act like you want a confrontation
I packs my gat I gotta stay strapped
I bust mines dont try to sneak up on me from behind
Dont sleep I get deep when I creep
I see right now I got to show you it aint nothin sweet
Go get your muthafuckin hammer
And act like you want drama
I send a message to your mama
Hello do you know your one son left
I had license to kill and he had been marked for death
Hes up the Hill in the back of the building with two in the dome
I left him stiffer than a tombstone
I used to pack sling shots but now Im packin heavy metal
Is Lil Fame muthafucka slap Lil Mallet
When I let off its a burning desire
Niggas increase the peace cause when I release it be rapid fire
For the cause I drop niggas like drawers
Niggasll hit the floors from the muthafuckin 44s
Im talkin titles when its showtime
Fuck around I have niggas call the injury help line
I bust words in my verse thatll serve
Even on my first nerve I put herbs to curbs
I aint about givin niggas a chance
And I still raise shit to make my brother wanna get up and dance
Front I make it a thrill to kill
Bringin the ruckus its the neighborhood hoods for the Hill thats real
Me and mics thats unlike niggas and dykes
So who wanna skate cause Im puttin niggas on ice
Whatever I drop must be rough rugged and hard more
Yo here I am Get it on cocksucker
That nigga Bill seem to be a ill black brother
I gets dough from the way I flow
That I aint nothin to fuck with duck quick
I squeeze when Im stressed
Them teflonsll tear through your vest
I love a bloodbath
You can feel the wrath
Boom Ease up off the trigger
Its aight me and shorty go to gunfights
Together we bring the ruckus right
I earned mine so Im entitled to a title
that means Im homicidal
Yo I scream on niggas like a rollercoaster
To them wack muthafuckas go hang it up like a poster
Niggas get excited but dont excite me
Dont invite me Im splittin niggas heads where the white be
Try to trash this this little bastardll blast it
Only puttin niggas in comas and caskets
I aint a phoney I put the mack in a roni
I leave you lonely
Up in your anus I pack steel thats stainless
We came to claim this and Lil Famell make you famous
I mack hoes rock shows and stack dough
Cause Im in effect knockin muthafuckas like fiveo
Im catchin other niggas peepin shit I aint sleepin
I roll deep like a muthafuckin PuertoRican
So when I write my competition looks sadly
For brokeass niggas I make it happen like Mariah Carey
I got shit for niggas that roll bold
Lil Fame is like a orthopedic shoe I got mad soul
Ima kill em before I duck em
Because yo mother made em mother had em and muthafuck em
Lil Fame up in this muthafucka
Givin shoutouts to my man DR Period
My man Broke Ass Moe

In the battle lost my finger Mic became my arm
Pistol nozzle hits your nasal blood becomes lukewarm
Tell the woman be easy Naah squeeze the Charmin
Test Wyclef see death flesh get scorned
Beat you so bad make you feel like you aint wanna be born
And tell your friends stay the hell out of my lawn
Chicken George became Dead George stealin chickens from my farm
Damn Another dead pigeon
If your mafiosos then Im bringin on Haitian Sicilians
Nobodys shootin my bodys made of hand grenade
Girl bled to death while she was tonguekissing a razor blade
That sounds sick maybe one eday Ill write a horror
Blackula comes to the ghetto jacks an ACURA
Stevie Wonder sees Crack Babies BeComing Enemies of their own families
Armageddon come you know we soon done

Who that be enemies wanna see the death of me
From Hawaii to Hawthorne I run marathons like
Buju Banton Im a true champion like
Farakkhan reads his Daily Quran its a phenomenon lyrics fast like Ramadan
Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon trying to front like hes down with Mount Zion
Oooh La La La Its the way that we rock when were doing our thang
Oooh La La La Its the natural LA that the Refugees Bring
Oooh La La La La La La Lalala La Laaah Sweeeeet ThingAnd so it was written and after all these things
I saw another angel come down from heaven
Having great power and the eath was lighted with his glory
And he cried mightily with the strong voice saying Babylon the great has
its fallen and has become the habitation of devils
and the home to every fowl spirit and a cage of very unclean and hateful men

9 to 5These are the tales the freaky tales
The tales that I tell so well
I met this girl her name was Joan
She loved the way I rocked the microphone
When I met Joan I took her home
She was just like a doggy all on my bone
I met another girl her name was Ann
All she wanted was to freak with a man
When I met Ann I soked her pans
We ended up freakin by garbage can
The next young freak I met was Red
I took her to the house and she gave me head
She likes to freak was all she said
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed
Theres another girl her name is Mary
Talked about sex and the girl acted scary
I heard she was freakin for my homeboy Jerry
Took her to the house and I popped that cherry
Young and tender sweet Denise
Get her in the bed and the girls a beast
I tell you homeboy If you get a piece
She only talks about signin a lease
I met this tender her name was Lori
And a Xrated movie wouldnt tell her story
She had a twinsister her name was Lisa
And just like Lori shes a real dick pleaser
My girlfriends name was Michelle I freaked her well
Her pussy got hotter than flames in hell
I geed this girl her name was Tammy
I didnt wanna do it cause the bitch was flammy
She had a best friend her name was Jane
I pulled to the side and I spitted that game
I met a lot of freaks in my lifespine
Freaked one night with a girl named Pam
The very next day I saw her with her man
One week passed and I was in her again
I had an old tender her name was Janie
She was thirtytwo and I was only eighteen
She likes to freak shes just a fiend
It really didnt matter when I saw her in jeans
I wanna big freak fat and slobby
I kick on back and I watch her mouth
Two tons of fun big mama jama
I met this girl her name was Betty
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death
I was tired as hell I was drippin sweat
But I was all up in her tryin to hold my breath
Bake and shake us I met this freak in Vegas
She said her name was Donna
She was a pitty little freak from China
I said I dont pimp or gigolo
Im havin so much money that I dont need a hoe
You can break yourself but you cant break me
You never met a player like hort baby
I knew a dick sucker named BettyJo
Took her to my home and we did it on the floor
The girl got freaky and I tell you more
She was down on her knees beggin to blow
Shes like another freak named Ren
You get her alone and shell make your day
Like Burger King she knows the play
But a freak like Ren you can have it your way
These are the tales the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
I met this girl thick as hell
Only sixteen said her name was Linell
I took her to my house I could not wait
Her shit was much tighter than Central Safe
Let me tell you this since we talkin young
I met another girl said her name was Yvonne
Always talkin about havin fun
Once again in the bed I got it goin on
Im Sir Too hort couldnt be no punk
I try to get funky like female funk
So when you see me comin or see me goin
I keep my money let the hoes keep throwin
I once met a tender she did it for free
On the Foothill bust number fortythree
All the way on the back she was workin me
Had my big beatbox and I was jammin the beat
I met this freak named aunt Winell
Macked on the baby like an icecold vet
Everythin she had is what I get
Cause Im Too hort baby I dont play that shit
I met another freak her name was Rita
Baby thought that hort just might eat her
I told her like this she can suck my peter
Or even go home cause I knew I didnt need her
Scratched her name off my telephone book
Never again I took a second look
Cause the next young freak her name was Sharon
She kept lookin well I kept stairin
Her booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearin
She never left she cutted out
I know you all know what Im talkin about
Theres a freak named Shane such a sinner
She smokes that pipe and shes gettin thinner
Shane is cool but her mind is gone
One fat rock and its goin on
She had another buddy came by my place
Thick ass bitch said her name was Grace
She walked in the door wearin a lace
You shoulda seen that look that was on my face
Shes like this tender named Belinda
Homeboys call her Belinda the Blender
She gave head like she made it up
She was twenty years old with a big round butt
Had a girl slick like olive oil
Her father was rich and the girl was spoiled
When she got mad he blood would boil
But I rapped her off like Im lookin a toy
These are the tales the freaky tales
The tales that I tell so well
Shockedy life Friday night its goin on Too hort
Three weeks ago I met this freak
She followed me around like Marys sheep
I hitted around the corner and when she came
I grabbed her by the arm and I asked her name
She said it was Nina and her mans in Santa Rita
I took her to my home and homeboy I geed her
Set her on the way the very next way
Playboy hort was ready to play
I bumped to this girl her name was Roseanne
We hitted the motel and got it goin on
Holiday Inn to the break of dawn
When I took baby home I freaked her mom
I knew this tender named Shanie
I took her to the house and let her freak on me
Baby was a fan she loved my beat
But I wouldnt raise my leg to let her kiss my feet
I met this freak named Yolanda
Rolled baby doll like a brand new Honda
I was on top and she was up under
The bed hitted the wall and it sounded like thunder
I once had a datewith girl named Kitty
She was so fine with big fat tiddies
All night long she was actin shitty
So i macked on baby like I was Frank Nitti
Theres another girl her name is Rose
I use to roll baby like brand new Volvos
I never saw Rose wearin clothes
Shes a pimp house pet ready to pose
I was ridin down the street when I met Janet
Her booty was bigger than the whole damn planet
Ass everywhere I just cant stand it
Tried to poem it but I could not manage
I had this freak her name was Bunny
Said I was the only man who ever called her honey
Everythin I did to her was funny
I macked on bunny and I took her money
Eight tonight a date with Shirlie
She was really short and her hair was curly
If you saw baby you liked this girlie
She was so fine I went to get her early
Shirlie was freakin like a girl named Rachel
Her bite was vicious and it sure was fatal
She liked to kiss all on my neval
Those are her lips on top of my label
I knew another freak her name was Candy
Real big lips and they came in handy
I smooth got worked and it was so dandy
I hooked the brood up with my homeboy Randy
He did me a favor in return
Gave me a lizard said her name was Laverne
Baby got tossed and I got it on
I grabbed the mic and started to sing my song
My young homeboy heard me rap
And said he had way more freaks than that
So I told him like this they might be freakin
But boy you never had that TPTreatmentAs I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life
And realize theres nothing left
Cause Ive been blasting and laughing so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind has gone
But I aint never crossed a man that didnt deserve it
Me be treated like a punk you know thats unheard of
You betta watch how ya talking
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta lob
As they croak I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool Im the kinda g that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night
Saying prayers in the street light
Weve been spending most our lives
Living in a gangstas paradise
Weve been spending most our lives
Living in a gangstas paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangstas paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangstas paradise
Look at the situation they got me facing
I cant live a normal life I was raised by the state
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching got me chasing dreams
Im an educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
Im a locked out gangsta set tripping banger
And my homies are down so dont arouse my anger
Fool death aint nothing but a heart beat away
Im living life do or die what can I say
Im twentythree now will I ever live to see twentyfour
The way things is going I dont know
Tell me why are we
That the ones we hurt
Weve been spending most our lives
Living in a gangstas paradise
Weve been spending most our lives
Living in a gangstas paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangstas paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangstas paradise
Power in the money money in the power
Minute after minute hour after hour
Everybodys running but half of them aint looking
Its going on in the kitchen
But I dont know whats cooking
They say I gotta learn
But nobodys here to teach me
If they cant understand it how can they reach me
Thats why I know my life is out of luck foo
Weve been spending most our lives
Living in a gangstas paradise
Weve been spending most our lives
Living in a gangstas paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangstas paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangstas paradise
Tell me why are we
That the ones we hurt
Tell me why are we
That the ones we hurt
Are you and meJunior MAFIA
Grab your dick if you love hiphop
Rub your titties if you love Big Poppa
Gotcha open off the words I say because
This type of shit it happens everyday
Now who smoke more blunts than a little bit
What are you a idiot
Listen to the lyrics I spit like M1s
Got mad guns up in the cabin
Cause Cease aint the one for the dibbin and dabbin shit
I make it happen you got your ass caught
All you saw was fire from the Honda Passport
Or the MP what if you see then I miss ya
I blow up spots like little sisters
Gwan grit ya teeth gwan bite ya nails to the cuticles
Like Murray my killings be the most beautiful
Junior MAFIA click thick like Luke dancers
Niggaz grab your gats bitches take a glance at
The little one pullin over in the Land Rover
Playin Big Willie style with a chaffeur yaknahmean
Stack the green read all between the lines
A nigga act up makes the bastard hard to find
Im surrounded by criminals
Heavy rollers even the sheisty individuals
Smokin skunk and mad Phillies
Beatin down Billy Badasses cracks in stacks and masses
If robberys a class bet I pass it
Shit get drastic Im buryin ya bastards
Take you to the church rob the preacher for the offerin
Leave the fucker coughin up blood and his pockets like rabbit ears
Covered the wife kleenex for the kids tears
Versace wear Moschino on my bitches
She whippin my ride countin my ones thinkin Im richest
Just the way players play all day everyday
I dont know what else to say
Ive been robbin niggaz since Run and them was singin Here We Go
Snatchin ropes at the Roxie homeboy you didnt know
My flow detrimental to your health
Usually roll for self I have son ridin shotgun
My minds my nine my pens my Mac10
My target all you wack niggaz who started rappin
Junior MAFIA steelo niggaz know the half
Caviar for breakfast champagne bubble baths
Runnin up in pretty bitches constantly
The Smalls bitch who the fuck it was supposed to be
I used to pack Macs in Cadillacs
Now I pimp gats in the Acs watch my niggaz backs
Nines in the stores glocks in the bags
Maxin minimarkets gettin money with the Arabs
No question confession yes its the lyrical
Bitches squeeze your tits niggaz grab your genitals
Proteins and minerals excluse subliminals
Big Momma shoots the game to all you Willies and criminals
I kick the rilli with my peeps all day
325s roll by with the windows down halfway
DKNY oh my Im jiggy
Its all about the Smalls and my fuckin nigga Biggie
Bitches love the way I bust a rhyme
Cause they all in line screamin one more time
Niggaz grab your dicks if you love hiphop
Bitches rubadub in the back of the club straight up
