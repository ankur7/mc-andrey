You know I'm slippin'
Girl you got me trippin'
All the love you're givin'
You know
You're so good to me
I don't know
What you do to me
I never thought this is
Where I'd be
Every day is like
Hide and seek
But I know where you are
My heart is racin'
Anticipatin'
No way I can fake it
I've fallen much too far
I made a promise to myself
That I'd never let someone
Ever get this close
But every time
I'm in your arms
My world turns upside down
You know I'm slippin'
Girl you got me trippin'
All the love you're givin'
You know
You're so good to me
You know I'm slippin'
Every time we're kissin'
You've got
What I've been missin'
You make my heart complete
You know I'm slippin'
You give me everything
A man could need
I'm caught on fire
By the way you please
You're the one
In my fantasy
Every night
You're in my dreams
My mind must be
Playing tricks
I never thought
That you'd exist
I don't know what
To make of this
Are you really
What you seem
I made a promise to myself
That I'd never let someone
Ever get this close
But every time
I'm in your arms
My world turns upside down
It took a while
Before I noticed you
I wasn't willing
To let you through
I can't imagine
How things would be
If you didn't come along
And set me free
